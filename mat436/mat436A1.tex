Q1: Bee flying problem: \\
Since the trains are approaching eachother at $50m/s$, and they start at a distance of $100m$ apart, they will meet in $1$ second according to basic kinematics. Since the bee travels at $100m/s$, it will move a total of $100m$ before the trains collide.

Q2: Derive Gauss' summation for first n integers: \\ We claim that the following formula holds $$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ We proceed by induction. For $n=1$ it is clear that $\sum_{i=1}^1 i =1$. Suppose that the formula holds for $n$. We claim that this implies that the formula is true for $n+1$. Observe: 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} i = \sum_{i=1}^n i +(n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) = \frac{n^2 +3n+2}{2} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$$
We conclude that the formula holds for all $n$ by the principle of induction. Thus we see that Gauss' summation of integers from 1 to 100 was quite simple he only had to compute: 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{100} i = \frac{100(100+1)}{2} = 5050$$ 
\newline \\ Q3: Suppose there is a tennis tournament with 128 players, how many matches are played in total?
\\ We can compute this as a finite geometric sum. $$\text{total played} = \sum_{i=1}^7 128 \frac{1}{2}^i = 64 \sum_{i=0}^{7} \frac{1}{2}^{i-1} = 64(\frac{1-(\frac{1}{2})^7}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}) = 127$$
Alternatively, we could compute out the sum $64+ 32 + \dots + 1 = 127$.
