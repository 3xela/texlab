Q5a:\\
Suppose that $A$ is a unbounded set of content 0. Then for any $\varepsilon>0$ we can find a finite collection of closed rectangles $U_1\dots U_n$ such that $\bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i \supset A$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n vol(U_i) < \varepsilon$
. Since we are dealing with a finite collection of closed rectangles, we can choose a closed rectangle $W$ such that each $U_i \subset W$. This is the same as saying $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i \subset W$. Therefore $A$ is bounded, a contradiction. 
\\ 5b: \\
Consider the set of all integers as a subset of $\R$. This is closed, since $\R \setminus \Z = \bigcup_{i\in \Z} (i, i+1)$ which is the arbitrary union of open sets hence is open. Since $\Z$ is countable, we can rewrite $\Z$ as the countable union of each of its elements. Since a point is of measure 0, Spivak Theorem 3-4 says a countable union of measure 0 sets is of measure 0 as well. Since $\Z$ is unbounded, we have by 5a that it can not be of content 0. Thus $\Z$ viewed as a subset of $\R$ is closed and of measure 0 but not content 0.
