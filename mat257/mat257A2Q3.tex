Q3:\\
Since $U$ open, $U^c$ must be closed. it then follows from 2b that there exists some $d$ such that $\norm{x-y} \geq d$ for all $x \in U^c$ and $y \in C$. Now, we cover each $y\in C$ with a ball of radius $\frac{d}{2}$. 
This is an open cover of $C$, so we can take a finite subcover by compactness of $C$. Let $D$ be the closure of this finite subcover. We first claim that $D$ is a compact set. Note that $D$ is the finite union of closed balls with radius $\frac{d}{2}$. It follows that $D$ is closed and bounded and thus is compact by the Heine Borel Theorem. Note that as well, since every point in $D$ is at most $\frac{d}{2}$ away from $U^c$, $D$ must be disjoint with $U^c$ and as such $D \subset U$. 
Finally it remains to show that $C \subset int D$. Suppose that $x\in C$. From our choice of $D$ , there must exist an open ball centered at some point $y$, $B_{\frac{d}{2}}(y)$, such that $x$ belongs to this open ball. Since this ball is open we can find some smaller open set $U$ with $x\in U \subset B_{\frac{d}{2}}(y)$. This is exactly what it means to be in the interiour of $D$. Therefore, $C \subset int D$.
