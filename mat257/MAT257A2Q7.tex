Q7: 
\\
"$\implies$"
\\ Suppose that $C$ is compact. Let $O$ be an open cover of $C$ such that $O$ is closed under union of pairs of its elements. Since $C$ is compact, there exists some finite set of covers $U_1 \dots U_n$ where $C \subset \cup_{i=1}^n U_i$. $O$ is closed under unions,so we have that $\cup_{i=1}^n U_i \in O$. 
Take $T = \cup_{i=1}^n U_i$ and the result follows.

"$\impliedby$"
\\
Suppose that $O$ is an open cover of the set $C$. We construct a new open cover $O'$ in the following way. Let $O' = \{ \text{finite unions of } u \in O\}$. $O'$ is closed under pairwise union, since when we take the union of 2 sets, $u_1,u_2 \in O'$, there are some finitely many sets in $O$ which have unions of $u_1$ and $u_2$, and their union will also be a finite union of sets in $O$. By assumption, there is some $T \in O'$ with $C\subset T$. Therefore, $T$ is the finite union of some open sets in $O$. And so for any open cover $O$, we can find a finite subcover which also covers $C$. Thus $C$ is compact. $\qed$
