\noindent Q3: For each $x\in C$, we can rewrite it as a base 3 decimal expansion whose entries are either 0 or 2. Denote this by $x=(x_n)$. 
Consider the mapping $f: C \to [0,1]$ defined as $$f((x_n)_{base 3}) = (g(x_1),g(x_2) \dots)_{base 2} $$ Where $$g(x_i) =  \begin{cases} 
    1 & x_i = 2 \\
    0 & x_i = 0
 \end{cases} $$ 
We claim that $f$ is a continuous surjective map. Suppose that $y\in[0,1]$. Then it has some decimal expansion of the form $y=(a_n)$.
In base 2 this will be a string of 0's and 1's. If we take $x\in C$ to have a 2 where ever there is a 1 in the decimal expansion of $y$, with the 0's remaining unchanged, we have that $f(x)=y$.
We now claim that such an $f$ is continuous. Notice that $f$ can be represented as the composition of several continuous maps. First, we swap every 2 to a 1, then we convert from base 3 to base 2. 
Converting between number bases amounts to addition and multiplication, and thus is continuous. It remains to show that swapping 2's to 1's in a trinary number is a continuous function. Let $h$ be the function  on the Cantor set which changes a 2 to a 1. Since each element in the Cantor set has a trinary expansion with either a 2 or a 0, then 
$h(x)=\frac{x}{2}$. Thus $h$ is division by a nonzero and hence is continuous.
