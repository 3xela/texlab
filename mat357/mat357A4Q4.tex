\noindent Q4a: Let $\varepsilon>0$. Define $g_n = f_n-f$. Since $f_n \leq f_{n+1}$, we have that $g_n$ is a decreasing sequence. $g_n$ is also continuous, since it is the sum of continuous functions, with its limit being 0. Let $G_n = g_n^{pre}(-\infty,\varepsilon)$. This will be an open set in $[a,b]$ by continuity. We have that $G_n \subset G_{n+1}$. Therefore, the set $\{G_n\}$ forms an open cover of $[a,b]$. By compactness, there is a finite subcover. Let $G_N$ be the largest such set, which contains every other element of the finite subcover. Therefore, if $n\geq N $, we have that $|g_n|<\varepsilon$ and so $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$
\newline 4b: If $g_n$ is an increasing convergent sequence bounded above by $g_n$, setting $g_n(x) = -f_n(x)$ and applying 4a shows that it is indeed uniformly convergent
\newline 4c: Not true, since we require that every open cover has a finite subcover. 
\newline 4d: If $[a,b] $ is replaced with a compact metric space, this will also be true, since in our proof for 4a, we made no assumptions about the domain except that it is compact.
