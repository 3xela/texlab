\noindent Q4ai: Note that the interval $(-\ep,\ep)$ covers the empty set, and by the epsilon principle it has a Jordan content of 0. 
\newline ii: This is true since every open cover of $B$ will also be an open cover of $A$. Hence the Jordan content of $B$ will be at least the Jordan content of $A$
\newline iii: We see given $\ep >0$ we can cover each $A_n$ with a covering $\{ I_{k,n}: k\in \N\}$, we have that $$\sum_k |I_{k,n}| \leq J^{*}A_n + \frac{\ep}{2^n}$$. We have that $\{I_{k,n}: k,n\in \N\}$ is a covering of $A$, and $$\sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1} |I_{k,n}| \leq \sum_{n=1}^N J^{*}A_n + \frac{\varepsilon}{2^n} < \sum_{n=1}^N m^{*}A + \varepsilon$$
Therefore the infimum of total lengths of finite coverings of $A$ is less than sum of lengths of coverings for each $A_n$
\newline \\ Q4b: Consider the set $A = (0,1)\cap \Q$. We can write $A$ as countable union of singletons $q\in A$. We have that $J^{*}A_i=0$, since singletons can be covered with an arbitrarily small interval, yet $J^{*}A=1$. 
\newline \\ Q4c: It is clear that $m^{*}A\leq J^{*}A$ since every finite cover of a set is also a countable cover, hence we are intaking the infimum over a larger set, so it can be less. If $A$ is compact, then we have that every countable cover will have a finite subcover, so the infimum of the volumes of intervals which cover the set $A$ will be equal. The converse is not true however, since if we take $A=(0,1)$ we have that $J^{*}A = m^{*}A$ yet $A$ is not compact. 
\newline \\ Q4d: It is sufficient to show that the Jordan measure of an open and closed interval are equal. Note that for $\ep>0$, $[a,b]\subset (a-\ep,b+\ep)$ and $(a,b)\subset (a-\ep,b+\ep)$ and hence they have the same measure. Therefore it is equivalent to cover a set with either open or closed intervals.
